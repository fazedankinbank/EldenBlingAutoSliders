# Elden Bling Auto Sliders
Automatically import or export Elden Ring character creation sliders. There are three main scenarios where you'll find this program useful:
- Automatically export your sliders from the game onto the [Elden Bling Sliders](https://eldenblingsliders.com/) website. No manual typing required. This can even be done on console if you use remote play on your PC. [Video](https://youtu.be/7AuwbdmkPG4)
- Automatically import sliders shared with you into Elden Ring. Importing is only possible on PC and the creator needs to share the JSON text created by this program or the website. [Video](https://youtu.be/eGzAVpAZXio)
- Export and import sliders on your PC so that you essentially have more than 15 save slots available.

Exporting works by sending key presses to navigate through each screen, taking screenshots where the slider numbers should be, and using text recognition to extract the numbers. This only works if your screen is set to 1080p resolution. Importing works by sending key presses based on the JSON text. There's a more detailed guide within the program on how to use it.

Github is only being used as a way to distribute the software and the code isn't open sourced.
